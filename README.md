# Sarcasm_Detection_Ensemble

Problem Statement: Effective sarcasm detection in Twitter tweets with improved classifier performance, while a single classifier does not provide better accuracy. An ensemble model of (SVC, Random Forest Decision Tree, AdaBoost), is proposed to obtain better accuracy.

Objectives : The project aims to propose an ensemble approach to boost the classifier performance and perform a comparative analysis of single classifier models with the proposed ensemble model, use k-fold cross-validation (10 folds) to ensure that every observation from the original dataset has a chance of being selected in the training and test data
